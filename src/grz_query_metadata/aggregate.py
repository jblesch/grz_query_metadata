"""Aggregate per-GRZ survey reports into one spreadsheet.

Takes the grz-survey-*.json files produced by the survey command and writes an
OpenDocument spreadsheet (.ods) with one sheet per surveyed field: values down
the rows, GRZs across the columns, totals and share of all observations.

Optionally checks the free-text kit and instrument fields against a proposed
controlled vocabulary, so you can see what share of real values a candidate
enum would actually cover.
